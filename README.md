underscore-node
===============

Underscore for Node.js without cross-browser checks.

This is a ported version of [Underscore][1] targeted for Node.js on V8 JavaScript Engine.

Its purpose is to have the exactly same API and functionalities but with better perfomance and smaller code size.

It is accomplished by eliminating unnecessary cross-browser compatibility efforts.

Its APIs can be found in [here][2], and it is fully tested with the same tests for original Underscore.


Disclaimer
==========

This version is targeted for Node.js on V8, NOT for browsers or any other JavaScript engines.

This means there will be no efforts to support different JavaScript versions or behaviours.
